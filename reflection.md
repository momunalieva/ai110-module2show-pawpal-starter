# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

My initial design includes four classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler.

- **Owner:** Stores the owner's information and their pets.
- **Pet:** Stores information about each pet, such as its name, age, and type.
- **Task:** Represents activities such as feeding, walking, medication, and appointments.
- **Scheduler:** Organizes tasks, sorts them by time or priority, and checks for scheduling conflicts.

These classes work together to help pet owners manage their pets' daily routines.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

During implementation, I used Python's snake_case naming convention instead of the camelCase names in my original UML diagram. I also made scheduled start and end times optional so users can create tasks before scheduling them. These changes made the Python code easier to work with while keeping the original design.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
